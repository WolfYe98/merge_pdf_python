# Merge PDFs
This is a simply GUI app created for merging pdfs.
I have created this app using Python.
Some library I used are:
[Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) for GUI part.

[PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/) for merge the pdfs.

For installing PyPDF2, execute:

```bash
  $ pip install pypdf2
```

or

```bash
  $ pip3 install pypdf2
```

Then, clone this repository and execute:

```bash
  $ python3 app.py
```
